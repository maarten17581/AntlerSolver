# AntlerSolver
 Uses antler structures to solve the FVS problem on graphs

 This code is build upon the code from Iwata given in the following 2 papers
 - Yoichi Iwata, Magnus Wahlstr√∂m, Yuichi Yoshida: Half-integrality, LP-branching, and FPT Algorithms. SIAM J. Comput. 45(4): 1377-1411 (2016)
 - Yoichi Iwata: Linear-Time Kernelization for Feedback Vertex Set. ICALP 2017: 68:1-68:14
